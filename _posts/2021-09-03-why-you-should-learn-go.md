**Why GO now ?**

In a world of billions of humans using computers and phones ,serving this population with software solutions comes at a cost of both processing power and also engineering skills, However , programming languages have become a bottleneck in achieving this .  it is from this reason go was developed.

This library originally developed by google (Rob Pike and ) is a light weight programming language for building systems .

Here is a sample hello world program

```go
import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```
<p>And now, we are going to <strong>klipsify</strong> this code snippet:</p>

<pre markdown="0"><code class="language-klipse-go">
import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
</code></pre>


**Pros  of  Volley.**

-Light weight
- Statically typed (type safety)
- Fast 
- Scalable
- Memory efficient

**Cons.**

- No support for generics
